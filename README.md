# Focus:
	This is an idea that I’ve had for many months now but just felt like I didn’t have the time nor the confidence to take on such a project. My goal was to create the homepage and finish the “read” page. I came up with the idea during my spring quarter off school, which I decided on because I was having a hard time with my mental health. I felt alone during the first couple months or so, and I turned to Google for a lot of answers to my questions. Once I started feeling better and more connected with different communities, I randomly looked back at my search history on “My Activity” at Google (https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity) and realized that along with driving directions to the grocery store, I was searching for some answers to my open-ended soul-searching questions, all to an automated search engine. While my first impression was to mock myself for being so stereotypically-Gen-Z (for turning to Google and not an actual human to have conversations with, because, “we’re constantly on our phones,”), I realized that often I found value in the search results. Google connected me to people who were generous and vulnerable enough to recount their own experiences for the opportunity to help others. I found a lot of comfort in that when I was struggling.
	Right from the beginning, I wanted to create a space where people could reflect on their own meaningful Google searches. The most-crucial life-questions probably aren’t answered by a couple searches in Google, but sometimes the results can guide someone to make empowering decisions. There’s so much power in that, and I wanted to share my experiences and provide a space where even the most obscure google searches can share the story of their inception and evolution

# My First Attempt:
	My mind was all over the place initially. I was laser-focused on making the website look so “cool” because I was kind of worried that people wouldn’t use it! It was a backwards-thinking mindset. I made this very quickly though so not much time was lost! The background is a GIF, and you can check it out at https://codepen.io/judgejudes/full/dxNXqj
 	I wanted to enable a search component to pay homage to Google, and it would filter all the individual blog posts (of others’ search stories), but also be fun and amusing in the background so as to be approachable. Even though thinking about the inception of the website idea makes me kind of emotional, I didn’t want the site to be just for sad stories, so I made the decision to be lighthearted, initially.

# On Second Thought…
	After thinking about it for a couple of days, I thought the design of the homepage looked childish, sloppy, and it just wasn’t true to myself. Of course I want people to use the website, but I felt that the homepage set the mood for the whole website, and I didn’t want to encourage myself nor other users to treat the website as a place for crude things they found on Google.
	It was hard scrapping the search bar and the GIF in the back since it took me a long time to correctly format those, but it had to be done! And I guess this is why I should’ve drawn this out on paper before coding—I’ll keep this in mind for next time!
	It was also around this time that I found another search result from my Google Search history from this summer--I was feeling some imposter syndrome for being a Computer Science student and feeling so “behind” for an incoming junior but also taking some time off for my mental health. So over the summer, I also searched, “I get so overwhelmed by coding I don’t have fun”. This is important later!
	
# A Start at a Second Attempt
	I just recently discovered the existence of the sector of “creative tech,” so I wanted to take the opportunity to put more self-expression in the homepage. I initially wrote a short poem, but just wrote a short introduction for the website with GIF’s and tied that into my Google search from earlier. I wanted to have fun making this website, paying little regard to how it looked. I just wanted to establish the correct atmosphere, but otherwise, things didn’t have to look pretty. Every time I refreshed the homepage, I was reminded to have fun with the project. This eased a lot of pressure off my shoulders.
	I then worked on the navbar (which I still don’t like, but will definitely be working on in the near future), specifically the “read” page. The final plan is to involve everyone’s submissions into this section, but I just wanted to put my own posts first, because I was under a time-crunch. I looked at other blogs for inspiration and found that blog posts were often stacked on top of one another (Fig 1), but I wanted users to be able to read titles (which would be the original google search) very quickly and choose what to read. I don’t expect all of my Google searches to be revelatory or interesting to everyone, so I wanted to encourage the user to choose to read whatever, whenever. So I put the posts side-by-side.
	I used techniques crucial to the CSS language, like flexbox so the page is responsive on a computer when the window is extended or minimized, but because of time, I was pretty “hacky” with it. As a CS student, I was comfortable with the fact that sometimes this is what happens! It’s pretty difficult to exclusively use a tool when I don’t understand it very well, but it was a testament to my love for computer science as I saw seemingly-random elements crash and break, and then retrace my steps to figure out what small semicolon or uncommented-out code was to blame.

# Next Steps
	I have so many visions for this website!
