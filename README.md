# Focus:
	This is an idea that I’ve had for many months now but just felt like I didn’t have the time nor the confidence to take on such a project. My goal was to create the homepage and finish the “read” page. I came up with the idea during my spring quarter off school, which I decided on because I was having a hard time with my mental health. I felt alone during the first couple months or so, and I turned to Google for a lot of answers to my questions. Once I started feeling better and more connected with different communities, I randomly looked back at my search history on “My Activity” at Google (https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity) and realized that along with driving directions to the grocery store, I was searching for some answers to my open-ended soul-searching questions, all to an automated search engine. While my first impression was to mock myself for being so stereotypically-Gen-Z (for turning to Google and not an actual human to have conversations with, because, “we’re constantly on our phones,”), I realized that often I found value in the search results. Google connected me to people who were generous and vulnerable enough to recount their own experiences for the opportunity to help others. I found a lot of comfort in that when I was struggling.
	Right from the beginning, I wanted to create a space where people could reflect on their own meaningful Google searches. The most-crucial life-questions probably aren’t answered by a couple searches in Google, but sometimes the results can guide someone to make empowering decisions. There’s so much power in that, and I wanted to share my experiences and provide a space where even the most obscure google searches can share the story of their inception and evolution

# My First Attempt:
	My mind was all over the place initially. I was laser-focused on making the website look so “cool” because I was kind of worried that people wouldn’t use it! It was a backwards-thinking mindset, but at least I practiced HTML and CSS, and made this! The background is a GIF, and you can check it out at https://codepen.io/judgejudes/full/dxNXqj
 	I wanted to enable a search component to pay homage to Google, and it would filter all the individual blog posts (of others’ search stories), but also be fun and amusing in the background so as to be approachable. Even though thinking about the inception of the website idea makes me kind of emotional, I didn’t want the site to be just for sad stories, so I made the decision to be lighthearted, initially.
